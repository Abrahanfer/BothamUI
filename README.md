# BothamUI

BothamUI is MVP(Model-View-Presenter) framework written in swift. In addition we will use a wireframe navigation model and a service locator example.

Project is under development.

## Usage

**_TODO_**

## Caveats

* ViewControllers instantiated view UIStoryboard, can't reference Generic Type.
* Presenter and ViewController have a circular reference (like a ViewController and Datasource).
